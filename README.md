# Movie Applications

This is a simple movie catalog application made using a tutorial for learning REACT 19. It includes API integrations for fetching movies, as well as an integrated database for storing the most searched movies in the application.
## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
